# Extend your program above. Draw five stars,
# but between each, pick up the pen, move forward by 350 units, turn
# right by 144, put the pen down, and draw the next star.
# Youâ€™ll get something like this (note that you will need to move to the left before
# drawing your first star in order to fit everything in the window)
